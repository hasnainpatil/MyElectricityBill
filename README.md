This project includes my solution to semi automating the process of calculating electricity bills. 
It calculates consumed units, generates bills, and offers features like data sharing, security, and debugging. 
It eliminates paper bills, manual tracking and the need for customers to visit offices, saving time and resources. 
This computerized system will make the overall billing system easy, accessible, comfortable and effective for consumers.
